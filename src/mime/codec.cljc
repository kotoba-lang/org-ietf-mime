  "Transfer encodings and charset decoding — RFC 2045 §6 and RFC 2047 §4.

  THE INPUT CONTRACT, which is the thing to get right before anything
  else here makes sense: every function in this library takes a **binary
  string** — the raw message bytes decoded one-byte-per-character
  (latin-1), so character `n` is byte `n`. It is NOT a UTF-8 decode of
  the message.

  A message is bytes. Its headers say which charset those bytes are in,
  and different parts of one message routinely disagree — a UTF-8 body
  next to an ISO-2022-JP subject next to a binary attachment. Decoding
  the whole thing as UTF-8 up front destroys every part that was not
  UTF-8, and quietly: you get U+FFFD, not an error. So the wire form
  stays byte-per-char until the headers say what each part is, and the
  decode happens here, per part.

    JS:  new TextDecoder('latin1').decode(bytes)

  for everything in between. The first version of this namespace used
  `int` throughout and every body decoded to a run of blanks."
