;; `kotoba/mime/framing.kotoba` against `mime.parse` and `mime.header`.
;;
;; Framing is the first thing a mail parser decides and everything else is
;; read off it, so a parser that puts the line somewhere else is reading a
;; different message from every other parser that touches the same bytes.
;;
;;   * `the-header-block-ends-at-the-wrong-blank-line` -- RFC 5322 §2.1 puts
;;     the body after the FIRST empty line. `split-message` searches for
;;     `"\r\n\r\n"` and then for `"\n\n"`, and `some` returns the first
;;     separator FOUND rather than the one occurring earliest. A message
;;     whose headers end in a bare LF and whose body later contains a CRLF
;;     CRLF splits at the later one, and two lines of body become two
;;     headers.
;;
;;   * `transport-padding-hides-a-part` -- RFC 2046 §5.1.1 spells the
;;     delimiter as `--boundary` followed by transport-padding and CRLF.
;;     `split-multipart` compares with `=`, so one trailing space makes the
;;     line invisible and the part it opened disappears.
;;
;;   * `a-field-name-may-not-contain-a-space` -- §2.2. `parse-headers`
;;     takes everything before the first colon and trims it, so
;;     `X-Evil : yes` is the header `x-evil`; and a line with no colon is
;;     dropped rather than refused, so bytes the parser could not read
;;     leave no trace.
;;
;; Parity is over the cases the library gets right -- an ordinary CRLF
;; message, an ordinary LF message, a message with no body -- so the
;; disagreements above are not the only thing being measured.
